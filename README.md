## Description

Custom Cyrillic phonetic layout based on the standard QWERTY keyboard layout. Each Latin key corresponds to a cyrillic letter with a similar sound. Cyrillic alphabet has more letters than Latin, so some of them are represented as a dead key combination. For example the letter 'ю' requires two keys to be pressed: key 'j' followed 'u'.

Windows keyboard layout is created with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.
