## Keyboard layout

Custom Cyrillic phonetic layout based on the standard QWERTY keyboard layout. Each latin key corresponds to a cyrillic letter with a similiar sound. Cyrillic alphabet has more letters then latin, so some of them are represented as a dead key combination. For example to enter 'ю' two keys need to be pressed: key 'j' followed 'u'.
